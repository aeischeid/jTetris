Browsers are perfect platform for games like this
=================================================

aesthetics matter in making a game enjoyable
--------------------------------------------

The game engine was already mostly written. I thought I could add some style for fun.

Improvements that would be fun:

*  title screen
*  Changing style/background based on levels
*  using browser database to record high scores
*  adding music
*  amimations for completed rows etc.
*  more challenging speed increments upon level advancements
*  game settings in UI
