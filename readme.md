Browsers are perfect platform for games like this
=================================================

aesthetics matter in making a game enjoyable
--------------------------------------------

The game engine was already written. I thought I could add some style for fun, learn from it, and rewrite it better using modern browser features.

Improvements that would be fun:

*  title screen
*  rewrite to canvas elements (and svg?)
*  Changing style/background based on levels
*  using browser database to record high scores
*  adding music
*  amimations for completed rows etc.
*  more challenging speed increments upon level advancements
*  game settings in UI
*  making it an 'installable' web-app
